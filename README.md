# Predicting the ‘recipe’ for a popular song on Spotify
A collaborative project undertaken by Aalto University students in course "Data Science for Business 1".

## Description
Nowadays, there are many songs that soar to the heights of popularity while others remain relatively unknown. In today's rapidly evolving music industry, a relatively 100,000 songs are uploaded each day. This situation creates a concern for music producers because they are unsure whether their creations will match audiences' preferrences. In this high-stakes scenario, how can producers minimize risks and enhance the likelihood of success? Our goal is to uncover discernible patterns and correlations within a variety of musical attributes, aiming to decipher the ingredients that formulate a "recipe" for a song's widespread popularity.

The research objectives are collect, clean and analyze Spotify dataset. Some variables are taken into account when assessing the popularity of a song such as key, mode or attributes (danceability, valence, energy, acousticness, ...). The final goal is to derive specific knowledge that allows music businesses to make better data-driven decisions.
