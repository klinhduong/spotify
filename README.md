# Predicting the ‘recipe’ for a popular song on Spotify
A collaborative project undertaken by Aalto University students in course "Sales & Operations Planning".

## Description
Electricity demand-along with prices-has been a regular discussion point in the media. Concerns about cost and efficiency call for accurate forecasting of electricity demand in order to reduce cost and avoid unneeded greenhouse gasses emission. Electricity consumption is affected by numerous factors (i.e. weather, holidays, day of the week. etc.), thus making it hard to forecast correctly.

The goal of this project is to produce electricity demand forecasts for 20.3, using historical data of electricity consumption in Finland from the start of 2020 onwards. To increase the accuracy of the forecast, the analysis should be based on the weather data for Helsinki, Tampere and Rovaniemi from the start of 2020, date information such as weekends and holidays. The result of the forecast should be the mean of the natural logarithm of the following day’s consumption, and the standard deviation of the forecasted number.
